        <h2>Why I Love You</h2>
        <div class="alert alert-primary">Itâ€™s more than just your smile, though that alone can brighten even the darkest of days. Itâ€™s the way you carry yourself, with grace and kindness. It's how you light up a room just by being in it. I find myself amazed by your strength, your intelligence, and the way you care for others. Youâ€™re so much more than what I could ever have imagined, and my admiration for you only grows each day.</div> 
      <div class="alert alert-primary">  <p>What I love the most, however, is how being around you feels like home. With you, I feel like Iâ€™m exactly where Iâ€™m meant to be. I don't need anything else. I donâ€™t need perfection, just your presence. Whether we're laughing, talking, or just sitting quietly together, every moment with you feels so meaningful and important.</p></div>  
     <div class="alert alert-primary">  <p>You make me want to be the best version of myself. You inspire me to be more courageous, more open, and more loving. Youâ€™ve brought so much joy into my life, and for that, Iâ€™ll always be grateful. But beyond that, thereâ€™s something I need to say: I love you. With all my heart, I love you. And Iâ€™m asking if you might give me the honor of being a part of your life, to share this journey together</div>

    <div class="message">
     <p>So here I am, pouring my heart out, hoping that you can feel the depth of my feelings for you. Will you let me love you? Will you allow me to be by your side, not just as someone who admires you from afar, but as someone who truly wants to walk through life with you? ðŸ’–</p>
    </div>
    <div class="message">
